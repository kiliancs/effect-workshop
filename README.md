# Effect Workshop

Introductory explanations and exercises for Effect beginners.

This is a work in progress. I plan on adding new sections on a monthly basis.

## Install

1. Install [bun](https://bun.sh/)
2. Clone this repo
3. Inside the repo dir, run `bun install`

## Usage

Under `/src`, each directory contains an `.exercise.ts` file, with small
exercises with a similar theme. Try to complete them and verify by running `bun
run test src/<dir-name>` (e.g. `bun run test src/schema-1`).

Each of these directories also contains a `.solution.ts` file that you should
try to not look at, and a `test.ts` file that is used to verify that you have
completed the exercises successfully.
